First step, please make a nandroid if you are unsure of what you are doing.

Second step, install busybox if it is not already installed. Either from the app or
from the binary I included (ie, adb shell busybox –install /system/xbin/)

Third step, push the four files zip, zipalign, dexo and dexopt-wrapper to /system/bin/

Fourth step, give the three files executable permissions (ie, chmod 755 zip zipalign dexo dexopt-wrapper)

Fifth step, run it!

Once the script is done, your phone will reboot. Your device will appear to be “frozen” until it reboots. That is ok.

Then all you will have to do is run:



adb pull /system/framework

adb pull /system/app


You are now done! The tool will automatically remove the classes.dex from your files as well as zipalign them. So you are optimized and ready to go.

Sample Terminal/Command prompt session. Basically you can copy and paste, ignoring the text after the # of course:

# Commands on Host computer

cd Downloads/universal-odex # change to the location you unzipped the odex tool.

adb remount

adb push dexo /system/bin/

adb push dexopt-wrapper /system/bin/

adb push zip /system/xbin/

adb push zipalign /system/xbin

adb push busybox /system/xbin # you may or may not already have busybox installed, but this will ensure that you have the correct applets installed

# Commands in ADB SHELL
adb shell # you just entered your Device’s shell
chmod 755 /system/bin/dexo /system/bin/dexopt-wrapper /system/xbin/zip /system/xbin/zipalign /system/xbin/busybox

busybox –install /system/xbin   #失败  
dexo # this will be the last command before your exit adb shell and your device reboots

# The “dexo” command executes SUPER fast. It should be done within 30s-1m, depending on ROM and device

# Commands on Host computer
cd Desktop
mkdir framework
mkdir app
adb pull /system/framework framework
adb pull /system/app app

# Rejoice.
If it doesn’t work for you, then you did something wrong. This is version 3.1 of the script and I’d like to think that I’ve fool-proofed it pretty well.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please post here.
